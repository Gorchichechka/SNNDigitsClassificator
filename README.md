# NumsClassification.ipynb

This Notebook demonstrates training and evaluation of a neural network for handwritten digit classification.
Net structure: 12C5 MP2 64C5 MP2 1024FCSL
Leaky neuron was used. 

In this model digit repeats every time step. 

# ToDo: use different spike coding. Compare results
